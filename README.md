# FactoryNewsReader

Master branch contains finished project.

To use the application first go into build.gradle module and change the PUT_IN_YOUR_API to your api from https://newsapi.org/.

There are some comments in the application since the request wasn't all to clear and I went with MVVM since I think it's better for this kind of application. 
There isn't a lot of comments becuase the code is pretty self-explanatory.
